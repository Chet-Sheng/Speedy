I remember that a graph consists of nodes (also called vertices) and edges, which connect these nodes. Each edge can be either directed or undirected. For this project, I think I should focus on undirected graphs because I'm more comfortable with that. \n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but how do I represent an undirected graph in Python? I've heard of adjacency lists, where each node has a list of its connected nodes. That sounds manageable. So, maybe I can create a class for the graph that has a dictionary where each key is a node, and the value is the list of connected nodes. \n",
      "\n",
      "But before I jump into coding, I should think about the structure of the graph. Should I include a method to add nodes and edges? I think yes, because users will need to create and modify the graph as they go. Also, I should consider the possibility of multiple edges between two nodes or loops (edges that connect a node to itself). Hmm, but for simplicity, maybe I should allow multiple edges but not loops. Or perhaps I can handle loops by allowing a node to be connected to itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, the problem statement doesn't specify any constraints on the graph, so perhaps it's better to handle all possible cases. So, in my implementation, I should allow for each node to have multiple edges to other nodes and also allow a node to have a self-loop.\n",
      "\n",
      "Okay, so first, I'll create a class called Graph. This class will have an adjacency dictionary, which is a mapping from nodes to their connected nodes. The initial graph will be empty. \n",
      "\n",
      "Next, I need to think about methods to add nodes and edges. For adding nodes, I can have a method called add_node, which takes a node name as an argument and adds it to the adjacency dictionary. For adding edges, since it's an undirected graph, when I add an edge between node A and node B, I need to add B to A's adjacency list and A to B's adjacency list. But I also need to ensure that the edge is added only once. So, perhaps I should check if B is already in A's adjacency list before adding it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but in an undirected graph, if I add an edge between A and B, it's the same as adding an edge between B and A. So, to avoid adding duplicates, I can check if B is in A's adjacency list. If not, add it. Otherwise, don't add it again. So, that way, each edge is added only once.\n",
      "\n",
      "But what about the order of adding edges? Since the graph is undirected, adding an edge A-B is the same as adding B-A. So, perhaps the add_edge method can take two nodes and add both directions. But wait, in an undirected graph, when adding an edge A-B, both A's adjacency list and B's adjacency list should include each other. So, the add_edge method should add both B to A's list and A to B's list.\n",
      "\n",
      "But wait, if the graph is undirected, then adding an edge A-B is the same as adding it B-A. So, perhaps the add_edge method should be used to add both directions. But in that case, when adding edges, I need to make sure that I don't add duplicates.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, the add_node method can be used to add nodes, and the add_edge method can be used to add edges between existing nodes. But that might complicate things because the add_edge method could be called with the same nodes twice, which would cause issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hmm, perhaps it's better to have an add_node method that adds nodes and an add_edge method that adds edges between nodes. But then, the add_edge method would need to check if the nodes already exist in the graph and whether they are connected. Wait, no, because add_edge could be called with any two nodes, and we need to make sure that adding an edge between them is allowed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, maybe the add_edge method can take two nodes and add both directions if they are not already present or if they are already present but the edge doesn't exist.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, perhaps the add_edge method can be used to add an edge between two nodes that may already exist in the graph. So, when adding an edge between A and B, if A is already in the graph, we check if B is already in A's adjacency list. If not, add it. Similarly, if B is already in the graph, check if A is in B's adjacency list. If not, add it. Otherwise, don't add it.\n",
      "\n",

If not, but there's a third person acting as a bridge, then they can still communicate. The goal is to check if all three can communicate with each other, possibly through the third.\n",

      "\n",
      "Wait, the problem says: if two can't talk directly but there's a third that is close enough to both, then they can communicate through that third. So the communication graph must be connected. But the three people can form a triangle where each is connected to the others directly, or there's a central node that connects the other two.\n",

      "\n",
      "Case 1: All three are pairwise within R. Then yes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Case 2: Two pairs are within R. For example, Chef to head server is within R, head server to sous-chef is within R. Then Chef and sous-chef can communicate through the head server. So all three can communicate.\n",

      "Case 3: Only one pair is within R, but the third is connected to both via that pair. Wait, no. For example, Chef and head server are within R. Chef and sous-chef are not. Head server and sous-chef are not. Then can the sous-chef communicate with Chef through the head server? Well, sous-chef would need to be within R of the head server, but that's not the case here. Wait, no. So if the head server is connected to Chef (distance <= R), and sous-chef is connected to the head server (distance <= R), then yes. But if the sous-chef is connected to neither, but connected via the Chef and head server? No. Wait, no. Because if the sous-chef is only connected to the Chef, but the Chef is connected to the head server, then sous-chef can communicate with the head server via Chef. But all three would need to form a connected graph.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to model the three points as a graph where edges exist between pairs if their distance is <= R. Then, check if the graph is connected. If the graph is connected, then all three can communicate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, that's right. Because if the graph is connected, then all nodes are reachable via some path. For three nodes, the possible connected graphs are:\n",

      "- A chain (A connected to B, B connected to C). Then A and C can communicate via B.\n",

      "1. Calculate the pairwise distances between all three points.\n",
      "2. For each pair, determine if the distance is <= R. If yes, that pair is connected.\n",

      "\n",
      "But how to check if the graph is connected with three nodes?\n",

      "Case 1: All three pairs are within R. Then connected.\n",

      "\n",
      "If the two edges are AB and BC, then connected (chain).\n",
      "\n",
      "But if two edges are AB and CA, then it's possible. Wait, AB is between A and B. CA is between C and A. So A is connected to both B and C. So B and C can communicate via A. So yes.\n",

      "To solve this problem, we need to determine if three people (Chef, head server, and sous-chef) can communicate with each other using transceivers that have a limited range. Communication can be direct if they are within the range or indirect via another person acting as an intermediary.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Approach\n",
      "1. **Input Reading**: Read the number of test cases and for each test case, read the maximum communication range (R) and the coordinates of the three people.\n",
      "2. **Distance Calculation**: For each pair of people, calculate the squared distance between their coordinates to avoid floating-point inaccuracies.\n",
      "3. **Check Communication**: Determine how many pairs can communicate directly by comparing their squared distance with \\( R^2 \\).\n",
      "4. **Connected Graph Check**: If at least two pairs can communicate directly, the three people form a connected graph either directly or through an intermediary, allowing all to communicate.\n",
