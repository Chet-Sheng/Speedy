## The `type()` Function for Dynamic Class Creation
The `type()` function has two forms:
- `type(obj)` - returns the type of an object
- `type(name, bases, dict)` - creates a new class dynamically

In your code, you're using the second form:
```python
DynamicConfig = type(
    'DynamicAppConfig',  # The name of the new class
    (cls,),              # A tuple of base classes (our AppConfig)
    {'model_config': dynamic_config} # A dict of class attributes
)
```
### How It Works
#### Parameters:

- `DynamicAppConfig`: The name of the new class (string)
- `(cls,)`: A tuple of base classes. Here cls refers to AppConfig, so the new class inherits from AppConfig. The comma makes it a tuple with one element.
- `{'model_config': dynamic_config}`: A dictionary of class attributes. This overrides the model_config attribute with your modified version that includes the toml_file path.

### What This Achieves
This pattern allows you to:

1. **Preserve the original class**: AppConfig remains unchanged
2. **Create a temporary variant**: The new class has all the same methods and attributes as `AppConfig`
3. **Override specific configuration**: Only the model_config is modified to include the dynamic TOML file path
4. **Maintain inheritance**: The new class inherits all behavior from `AppConfig`

### Equivalent Class Definition
The dynamically created class is equivalent to writing:
```python
class DynamicAppConfig(AppConfig):
    model_config = dynamic_config  # The modified config with toml_file
```
### Why Use Dynamic Creation?
This approach is particularly useful here because:
- Pydantic reads the `model_config` at class creation time
- You need different `TOML` file paths for different instances
- You can't modify `model_config` after the class is defined
- It allows you to create specialized versions of `AppConfig` with different configuration sources while maintaining the same interface
This is a powerful metaprogramming technique that gives you runtime flexibility while working within Pydantic's design constraints.
