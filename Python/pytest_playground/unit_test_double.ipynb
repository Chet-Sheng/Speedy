    "The `FakeQdrantClient` class is an excellent example of a test double (specifically a spy/mock) designed to make unit testing of Qdrant-dependent code much easier. Let me explain its implementation and the purpose of the `.calls` attribute:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### FakeQdrantClient Explained\n",
    "The FakeQdrantClient class simulates the behavior of a real QdrantClient but in a controlled, predictable manner that's ideal for testing. It has several key features:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The `.calls` Attribute\n",
    "\n",
    "    The `.calls` attribute is a `defaultdict(list)` that records every method call made to the fake client. This is a common pattern in test spies and is used for two main purposes:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Verifying Method Calls**: It allows test code to verify that the correct methods were called with the expected parameters. For example, you can check if `query_points` was called with the right collection name and query parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Debugging and Inspection**: It enables you to see the sequence and details of all calls made during a test, which is invaluable for understanding how your code interacts with the Qdrant client.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Here's how it works:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    def query_points(self, **kw):\n",
    "        self.calls[\"query_points\"].append(kw)  # Record the call and its parameters\n",
    "        # ... then return a simulated response\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    In your tests, you can then assert that specific calls were made:\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Simulated Responses**\n",
    "    For each method of the real `QdrantClient` that your code uses, `FakeQdrantClient` implements a simplified version that:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Records the method call in `.calls`\n",
    "    - Returns a minimalistic object that mimics the structure of the real response\n",
    "    \n",
    "    For example, `query_points` returns a response containing the requested number of scored points, with predictable IDs, scores, and payloads.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Collection Tracking**\n",
    "\n",
    "    The class also maintains a `collections` dictionary to track created collections and their points, making the fake client's behavior more realistic across multiple operations:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    def upsert(self, **kw):\n",
    "        self.calls[\"upsert\"].append(kw)\n",
    "        collection_name = kw.get(\"collection_name\")\n",
    "        points = kw.get(\"points\", [])\n",
    "        \n",
    "        # Track points in collections for more realistic testing\n",
    "        if collection_name not in self.collections:\n",
    "            self.collections[collection_name] = []\n",
    "        \n",
    "        self.collections[collection_name].extend(points)\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **SimpleNamespace Usage**\n",
    "    The implementation uses `SimpleNamespace` from the `types` module as a convenient way to create simple objects with arbitrary attributes. This is perfect for mocking complex nested response objects without having to implement their full functionality:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    return SimpleNamespace(config=cfg)\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Benefits of This Approach\n",
    "1. **Isolation**: Tests using `FakeQdrantClient` don't require a real Qdrant server, making them faster and more reliable.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Deterministic Behavior**: The fake client always returns the same predictable responses, eliminating test flakiness.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Verification Capability**: The `.calls` attribute lets you verify that your code is interacting with Qdrant in the expected way.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **No Side Effects**: Tests don't modify a real database, so they can be run safely in any environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Simplified Debugging**: You can easily inspect what calls were made to diagnose test failures.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a sophisticated and well-designed testing approach that follows best practices for unit testing code with external dependencies. The `.calls` attribute is central to making this approach effective, as it transforms the fake client from a simple stub (that just returns canned responses) into a spy (that also records how it was used)."
