You can see the method takes one parameter, self, which points to an instance of MyClass when the method is called (but of course instance methods can accept more than just one parameter).\n","\n","- Through the self parameter, instance methods can freely access attributes and other methods on the same object. This gives them a lot of power when it comes to modifying an object’s state.\n","\n","- Not only can they modify object state, instance methods can also access the class itself through the self.__class__ attribute. This means instance methods can also modify class state.\n","\n","`Class Methods`:\n","- Let’s compare that to the second method, `MyClass.classmethod`. I marked this method with a `@classmethod` decorator to flag it as a class method.\n","\n","- Instead of accepting a self parameter, class methods take a `cls` parameter that points to the class—and not the object instance—when the method is called.\n","\n","- Because the class method only has access to this `cls` argument, it can’t modify object instance state. That would require access to `self`. However, class methods can still modify class state that applies across all instances of the class.\n","\n","\n","\n","`Static Methods`: \n","- This type of method takes neither a `self` nor a `cls` parameter (but of course it’s free to accept an arbitrary number of other parameters).\n","- Therefore a static method can neither modify object state nor class state.
