    "To solve your race condition above, you need to find a way to allow only one thread at a time into the `read-modify-write` section of your code. \n",
    "\n",
    "The most common way to do this is called `Lock` in Python. In some other languages this same idea is called a `mutex`. `Mutex` comes from **MUTual EXclusion**, which is exactly what a Lock does.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A `Lock` is an object that acts like a **hall pass**. Only one thread at a time can have the `Lock`. Any other thread that wants the `Lock` must wait until the owner of the Lock gives it up.\n",
    "- The basic functions to do this are `.acquire()` and `.release()`. A thread will call `my_lock.acquire()` to get the lock. If the lock is already held, the calling thread will wait until it is released. There’s an important point here. If one thread gets the lock but never gives it back, your program will be stuck. You’ll read more about this later.\n",
    "- Python’s Lock will also operate as a context manager, so you can use it in a with statement, and it gets released automatically when the with block exits for any reason.\n",
